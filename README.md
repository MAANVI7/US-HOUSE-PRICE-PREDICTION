# US-HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION
Aim:  Find publicly available data for key factors that influence US home prices nationally. Then, build a data science model that explains how these factors impacted home prices over the last 20 years.
Use the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a proxy for home prices: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA.

Factors influencing house prices: 
The following are some national factors that may impact the supply and demand of homes in the US:
o	GDP
o	Unemployment rate
o	Consumer price index
o	Interest Rate
o	Customer price index
o	Monthly new house supply
o	Population of old people
o	Urban population
o	Housing subsidies
o	Working age population
o	Median Household income
o	Number of households 

In detail the effect of these factors is discussed hereunder:
1. GDP (Gross Domestic Product): A growing GDP typically indicates a robust economy with increasing income levels. Higher GDP often correlates with increased demand for homes, potentially driving prices up.

2. Unemployment Rate: A high unemployment rate can reduce individuals' ability to afford homes, leading to decreased demand and potentially lower prices. Conversely, a lower unemployment rate can stimulate demand and support price increases.

3. Consumer Price Index (CPI): CPI measures inflation and the purchasing power of consumers. A rising CPI may indicate increasing living costs, potentially impacting affordability. High inflation can lead to higher interest rates, affecting mortgage costs and home prices.

4. Interest Rate: Mortgage interest rates set by the Federal Reserve influence the cost of borrowing for homebuyers. Lower rates make mortgages more affordable, stimulating demand and potentially driving up home prices.

5. Consumer Price Index (CPI): CPI measures inflation and the purchasing power of consumers. A rising CPI may indicate increasing living costs, potentially impacting affordability. High inflation can lead to higher interest rates, affecting mortgage costs and home prices.

6. Monthly New House Supply: An increase in the supply of new houses, if not met with corresponding demand, can put downward pressure on prices. An oversupply of homes can lead to price decreases in certain markets.

7. Population of Old People: An aging population can influence the housing market as older individuals may downsize or seek different types of housing, potentially impacting prices in specific segments.

8. Urban Population: Urbanization trends can affect housing demand, especially in cities. High urbanization can lead to increased demand for housing in urban areas, potentially driving up prices.

9. Housing Subsidies: Government housing subsidies can make homeownership more accessible, potentially increasing demand and supporting home prices, particularly for lower-income households.

10. Working Age Population: An expanding working-age population can drive housing demand as individuals seek housing near their workplaces. This can support home prices in regions with strong job growth.

11. Median Household Income: Higher median household income levels generally correlate with greater purchasing power. Rising incomes can stimulate demand for homes, potentially pushing prices higher.

12. Number of Households: An increase in the number of households, driven by factors like population growth or changes in family structures, can boost demand for housing, potentially leading to higher prices.

It's important to note that the impact of these factors can vary by region and over time. Local market conditions, economic trends, and government policies also play crucial roles in determining how these factors influence the housing market in specific areas.
